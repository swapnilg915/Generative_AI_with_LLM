you will learn the fundamentals of 
	1. how Generative AI works and 
	2. how to deploy it in real world applications

Deep understanding of generative AI
key steps in typical LLM based generative AI lifecycle
	data gathering
	model selection
	performance evaluation
	deployment

- Transformer architecture that powers LLM's, 
- how they are retrained, 
- how finetuning enables LLM's to be adapted to a wide variety of specific use cases

use EMPIRICAL SCALING LAWS to optimize the model's objective function across 
	dataset size
	compute budget
	inference requirements

apply SOTA 
	training/tuning/inference tools
	deployments methods 

	to maximize the performance of models within the specific constraints of your project

Discuss the challenges and opportunities that Generative AI creates for businesses, 
	after hearing stories from Industry researchers and practioners
